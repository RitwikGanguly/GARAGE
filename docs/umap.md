# UMAP Visualization

## Overview

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique. It helps visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, usually two or three. UMAP leverages concepts from manifold learning and topological data analysis to capture the underlying structure of the data. The primary advantage of UMAP is its ability to preserve both the local and global structure of the data, making it ideal for visualization tasks where understanding the relationships between data points is crucial.

### Key Features

1. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - Reduces high-dimensional data while preserving underlying structure.

2. **Preservation of Local and Global Structure:**
   - Captures both local and global relationships in the data.

3. **Versatility:**
   - Applicable to various data types, including biological and image data.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Efficient and scalable to large datasets.

### Implementation

- Implemented in Python, commonly using the "umap-learn" library.

### Use Cases

- Exploratory data analysis.
- Pattern recognition in high-dimensional datasets.
