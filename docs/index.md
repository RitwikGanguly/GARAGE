# Summary

A python pipeline for synthetic single cell (scRNA-seq) data generation using graph attention-based GAN approach.


---

**GARAGE** (**G**raph-**A**ttentive **RA**re-cell aware single-cell data **GE**neration) is a novel deep learning framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data.

Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often struggle with the high-dimensional and sparse nature of scRNA-seq data, leading to training instability and a failure to reproduce rare but biologically important cell populations. GARAGE overcomes these challenges with a unique two-stage architecture that intelligently guides the generative process.

---

##  Workflow

The GARAGE framework uses a two-stage process to generate realistic synthetic cells, with a special focus on preserving rare cell types.

*A high-level overview of the GARAGE framework.*

1.  **Stage 1: GAT-based Cell Selection:**
    A Graph Attention Network (GAT) is first trained on a cell-cell neighborhood graph. By leveraging its attention mechanism, the GAT identifies a core set of "archetypal" or high-importance cells that are most influential in defining the data's structure and cell-type identities.

2.  **Stage 2: GAT-Seeded GAN Generation:**
    Instead of receiving only random noise, the GAN's generator is fed a **hybrid input batch**. This batch is a mixture of random vectors and the high-priority "seed" cells selected by the GAT. This "attention-guided leakage" anchors the generator to known, biologically realistic states, stabilizing training and ensuring all cell types are represented.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

*   **GAT-Informed Seeding:** Moves beyond random sampling to intelligently select the most representative cells to guide generation.
*   **Enhanced Rare Cell Generation:** The framework is explicitly designed to better capture and generate samples for rare and underrepresented cell populations.
*   **Improved Stability & Convergence:** The seeded-generation process significantly stabilizes GAN training, reduces mode collapse, and accelerates convergence.
*   **High-Fidelity Synthetic Data:** Produces synthetic datasets ideal for data augmentation, methods benchmarking, and privacy-preserving data sharing.
